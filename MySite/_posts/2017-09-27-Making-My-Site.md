# **Making My First Site (This One)**

## This was a crash course into how to code with Markdown then use a static site generator and theme to build the code and then how to get it online. I went through a couple key stages to get here.

- ### ***Installing Jekyll***
 - #### **Updating Ruby**
 - #### **Updating RubyGems**
- ### ***Using Jekyll***
 - #### **Generating default Jekyll Site**
 - #### **Getting my post into Default Site**
 - #### **Generating my site (without theme)**
- ### ***Applying a theme***
 - #### **Finding a theme**
 - #### **Generate theme site**
 - #### **Customize theme**
- ### ***Boom! It's beautiful!***
- ### ***Upload to domain***

### ***Installing Jekyll***
First, what is Jekyll. Jekyll is a static site generator that will take .md posts, a theme and generate the html and css necessary to launch. Jekyll required several things to install:

- Ruby 2.0 or higher
- RubyGems
- GCC & Make

I started with Ruby:

#### **Ruby**

Jekyll required Ruby 2.0 or higher. My Ruby was at 2.0 but I wanted the latest...

So, I went to Ruby's site and downloaded the latest version.

The files in the download were...foreign. Before proceeding, let's backup.

Ok, all safely backed up.

Back to Ruby's site to figure out how to install.
